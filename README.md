# Akka, Scala, sbt template

Because Typesafe Activator is a [poor replacement](https://github.com/typesafehub/akka-scala-sbt.g8/pull/7#issuecomment-32006874) for [giter8].

- [Scala] 2.10.3
- [Akka] 2.2.3 (`akka-actor` and `akka-testkit`)
- [sbt] 0.13.0

As I bump versions check the branches for previous versions of the packages referenced by this template.

Includes a sample `akka.Main` implementation so you can muck around with Actors immediately.
